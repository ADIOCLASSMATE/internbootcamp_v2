Okay, I need to count the number of rectangles in this ASCII grid. Let me look at the input carefully. The problem says that single rectangles are outlined with '#', and overlapping ones (maximum two) use '█'. Wait, but in the provided grid, I only see '#' characters and spaces. Maybe the user made a typo, but the given example seems to have only '#'s. So perhaps there are no overlapping ones here? Or maybe the example uses '█' but it's not rendered properly here. Hmm. Let me check the input again.

Looking at the grid provided, I see two distinct groups of '#'s. The first is a large rectangle that's 17 rows tall and 18 characters wide (since the first line of hashes starts with 16 '#', wait no, let me count again). Let me parse each part.

The first big rectangle starts after a lot of empty lines. The lines like:

                   ################     
                   #              #     
                   ... (many lines with # at start and end)
                   ################     

So the first rectangle: the top and bottom lines are 16 '#'s (assuming the first line is 16, but maybe I should count exactly). Let's see. The line is \"################\", which is 16 '#' characters. Then between them are lines like \"#              #\", which is a '#' at each end with 14 spaces in between. So this is a rectangle that's 16 characters wide (since the top and bottom are 16 '#'s) and how many tall? Let's count the lines between the top and bottom. The first line is \"################\", then there are 16 lines starting with \"#              #\", and then another \"################\". So the vertical lines are 16 + 2 (the top and bottom) lines? Wait, wait. Let me count:

The first block after the empty lines:

Line 1: ################ (top)
Lines 2-16: 16 lines (each with # at start and end)
Then line 17: ################ (bottom)
Wait, wait. Let's see: the vertical lines. The top is line 1. Then lines 2 to 17 (16 lines) have the vertical bars. Then line 18 is the bottom. So the height is 18 lines. Wait, no. The top and bottom are each one line. The vertical sides are each 16 lines. So total height is 16 + 2 = 18 lines. But the number of rows (height) for the rectangle is 16 (between top and bottom) plus the top and bottom, so the vertical lines are 16 + 2 = 18 lines? Wait, the rectangle's height is determined by the number of rows between the top and bottom borders. So if the top is at line Y, and the bottom is line Y + h - 1, then h is the number of lines for the vertical parts. So for example, if the vertical part is 16 lines, then the total height is 16 + 2 (top and bottom) lines. Wait, no. The vertical lines are the left and right borders. So for a rectangle with height h (vertical dimension), the vertical borders run for h lines. But the top and bottom borders are each 1 line. So the total number of lines in the rectangle is h + 2. But perhaps I'm overcomplicating. For the first rectangle, the vertical lines (left and right) are present on multiple lines. Let's count the lines between the top and bottom.

The first rectangle's code block has:

One line of 16 '#' (top)
Then 16 lines of # ... # (so left and right #)
Then another line of 16 '#' (bottom)
So the vertical lines (left and right) are present in 16 lines (the middle part). So the height of the rectangle is 16+2 = 18? Or the height is 16 (since the vertical lines are 16 lines long). For the purpose of the rectangle, the height is the number of lines between the top and bottom borders, which is 16 lines. Because the top is one line, then the vertical lines are 16 lines (the middle lines), then the bottom. So the vertical length (height) of the rectangle is 16 + 2? Or perhaps it's the vertical dimension as the number of lines occupied. Wait, perhaps the way to calculate the rectangle is that the top and bottom borders are horizontal lines. The left and right borders are vertical lines that run from the top to the bottom. So the vertical lines have to span the same rows as the top and bottom. So for a rectangle to be valid, all the vertical lines in between must have '#' at the left and right positions.

In the first rectangle, each of the lines between the top and bottom has a '#' at the start and end, so that's correct. So that's one rectangle. Then there's another group of lines further down:

                  ###########           
                  #         #           
                  ###########           

This is a smaller rectangle. The top is a line of 11 '#', then a line with # followed by 9 spaces and then #, then another line of 11 '#'. So the vertical lines here are one line in between. So the height of this rectangle is 2 (since between top and bottom there's one line, making the vertical lines 1+2=3 lines total? No, wait: the top is line 1, the middle is line 2, the bottom is line 3. So vertical lines are on lines 1,2,3. So the vertical dimension is 3 lines. The width is 11 characters (the top line has 11 '#'s). So this is a 3x11 rectangle? Wait, no. The width is 11 characters, but the horizontal lines are the top and bottom. The left and right borders are each at the first and 11th position. So this is a rectangle of width 11 and height 3.

So these are two separate rectangles. So the total count would be 2? But wait, maybe there are more. Are there any smaller rectangles nested inside the larger ones?

Wait, looking at the first big rectangle. Are there any smaller rectangles within it? For example, perhaps the vertical lines are made up of '#' but maybe some lines have more '#'s, forming smaller rectangles. But in the given grid, the lines between the top and bottom of the first rectangle are all # at the start and end, but the middle is spaces. So the only rectangles formed there are the big one. No inner rectangles since the middle is empty. So the first big rectangle is one.

The second group is the smaller rectangle. So that's two.

But wait, maybe the second group is three lines, but perhaps there's a 1x1 rectangle? No, because a rectangle requires four corners connected by lines. For example, a 1x1 rectangle would have a single '#' but that's not possible. So no, the second group is a single rectangle.

But wait, let's check the second part again:

The lines are:

                  ###########           
                  #         #           
                  ###########           

The first line is 11 '#'s. The second line is a #, then 9 spaces, then a #. The third line is 11 '#'s. So this is a rectangle of height 3 (since top, middle line, bottom) and width 11. So that's a valid rectangle.

Are there any other rectangles in the grid? Let's check the rest of the input. The lines above and below the two main blocks are all empty. So the total rectangles are two: the big one and the small one.

Wait, but maybe there are overlapping rectangles. But the problem states that overlapping is shown with '█' (which is a different character), but in the input given, all are '#' and spaces. So perhaps in this case, there's no overlapping, so each rectangle is entirely separate.

Therefore, the answer should be 2. But wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check again.

Wait, the first big rectangle: the top and bottom lines are 16 '#'s. So the width is 16. The vertical lines are 16 lines long. So that's a 16x16 rectangle? Or 16x18? Because the vertical lines are 16 lines (the middle part), plus the top and bottom. So height is 18 lines. Wait, but the problem counts rectangles based on their outlines. So the size doesn't matter; each separate outline is a rectangle.

Yes, the first block is a single rectangle. The second block is another single rectangle. So total is 2.

But wait, looking at the second block again. The top line is 11 '#', then a middle line with two '#' and spaces in between, then another 11 '#'. So this forms a rectangle. So yes, that's one. So total is 2.

Hmm, but maybe there's another rectangle in the second block. Wait, the middle line has # and #, but the top and bottom are solid lines. So that's one rectangle. So total two.

Therefore, the answer should be 2, boxed as \\boxed{2}.

Line 1: ################ (top)
Lines 2-16: 16 lines (each with # at start and end)
Then line 17: ################ (bottom)
Wait, wait. Let's see: the vertical lines. The top is line 1. Then lines 2 to 17 (16 lines) have the vertical bars. Then line 18 is the bottom. So the height is 18 lines. Wait, no. The top and bottom are each one line. The vertical sides are each 16 lines. So total height is 16 + 2 = 18 lines. But the number of rows (height) for the rectangle is 16 (between top and bottom) plus the top and bottom, so the vertical lines are 16 + 2 = 18 lines? Wait, the rectangle's height is determined by the number of rows between the top and bottom borders. So if the top is at line Y, and the bottom is line Y + h - 1, then h is the number of lines for the vertical parts. So for example, if the vertical part is 16 lines, then the total height is 16 + 2 (top and bottom) lines. Wait, no. The vertical lines are the left and right borders. So for a rectangle with height h (vertical dimension), the vertical borders run for h lines. But the top and bottom borders are each 1 line. So the total number of lines in the rectangle is h + 2. But perhaps I'm overcomplicating. For the first rectangle, the vertical lines (left and right) are present on multiple lines. Let's count the lines between the top and bottom.

So the vertical lines (left and right) are present in 16 lines (the middle part). So the height of the rectangle is 16+2 = 18? Or the height is 16 (since the vertical lines are 16 lines long). For the purpose of the rectangle, the height is the number of lines between the top and bottom borders, which is 16 lines.

So the height of this rectangle is 2 (since between top and bottom there's one line, making the vertical lines 1+2=3 lines total? No, wait: the top is line 1, the middle is line 2, the bottom is line 3. So vertical lines are on lines 1,2,3. So the vertical dimension is 3 lines. The width is 11 characters (the top line has 11 '#'s). So this is a 3x11 rectangle? Wait, no. The width is 11 characters, but the horizontal lines are the top and bottom. The left and right borders are each at the first and 11th position. So this is a rectangle of width 11 and height 3.

So these are two separate rectangles. So the total count would be 2? But wait, maybe there are more. Are there any smaller rectangles nested inside the larger ones?

Wait, looking at the first big rectangle. Are there any smaller rectangles within it? For example, perhaps the vertical lines are made up of '#' but maybe some lines have more '#'s, forming smaller rectangles. But in the given grid, the lines between the top and bottom of the first rectangle are all # at the start and end, but the middle is spaces. So the only rectangles formed there are the big one. No inner rectangles since the middle is empty. So the first big rectangle is one.

The second group is the smaller rectangle. So that's two.

But wait, maybe the second group is three lines, but perhaps there's a 1x1 rectangle? No, because a rectangle requires four corners connected by lines. For example, a 1x1 rectangle would have a single '#' but that's not possible. So no, the second group is a single rectangle.

                  ###########           

The first line is 11 '#'s. The second line is a #, then 9 spaces, then a #. The third line is 11 '#'s. So this is a rectangle of height 3 (since top, middle line, bottom) and width 11. So that's a valid rectangle.

Are there any other rectangles in the grid? Let's check the rest of the input. The lines above and below the two main blocks are all empty. So the total rectangles are two: the big one and the small one.

Therefore, the answer should be 2. But wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check again.

Wait, the first big rectangle: the top and bottom lines are 16 '#'s. So the width is 16. The vertical lines are 16 lines long. So that's a 16x16 rectangle? Or 16x18? Because the vertical lines are 16 lines (the middle part), plus the top and bottom. So height is 18 lines. Wait, but the problem counts rectangles based on their outlines. So the size doesn't matter; each separate outline is a rectangle.

Yes, the first block is a single rectangle. The second block is another single rectangle. So total is 2.

But wait, looking at the second block again. The top line is 11 '#', then a middle line with two '#' and spaces in between, then another 11 '#'. So this forms a rectangle. So yes, that's one. So total is 2.
