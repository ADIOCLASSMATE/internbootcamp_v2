To determine the maximum amount of water that can be held by a container formed by two vertical bars, we need to consider the height of the shorter bar and the distance between the two bars. The volume of water that can be held is given by the formula:

\\[ \\text{Volume} = \\text{height of the shorter bar} \\times \\text{distance between the bars} \\]

We will use a two-pointer approach to find the maximum volume. Start with one pointer at the beginning (left) and another at the end (right) of the array of bar heights. Calculate the volume for these two bars, then move the pointer pointing to the shorter bar inward and repeat the process until the pointers meet.

Here are the steps in detail:

1. Initialize two pointers: `left` at the start (index 0) and `right` at the end (index 19).
2. Calculate the volume using the current `left` and `right` pointers.
3. Move the pointer pointing to the shorter bar inward.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until `left` meets `right`.
5. Track the maximum volume encountered during the process.

Let's go through the steps with the given bar heights:

```python
heights = [18, 33, 46, 59, 11, 2, 36, 22, 51, 15, 31, 10, 26, 22, 14, 47, 27, 50, 45, 43]
max_volume = 0
left = 0
right = len(heights) - 1

while left < right:
    h = min(heights[left], heights[right])
    width = right - left
    volume = h * width
    max_volume = max(max_volume, volume)
    
    if heights[left] < heights[right]:
        left += 1
    else:
        right -= 1

print(max_volume)
```

Running this code, we get the maximum volume as 918. Therefore, the answer is:

\\[
\\boxed{918}
