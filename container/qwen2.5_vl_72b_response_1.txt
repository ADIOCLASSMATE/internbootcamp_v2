To determine the maximum amount of water that can be held by any two bars in the given image, we need to use the formula for the area of a rectangle, which is the width times the height. Here, the width is the distance between the two bars, and the height is the minimum height of the two bars.

We will iterate through all pairs of bars and calculate the area for each pair, keeping track of the maximum area found.

The heights of the bars from left to right are: 39, 18, 9, 20, 19, 5, 28, 20, 40, 13, 35, 31, 17, 9, 13, 27, 32, 2.

Let's denote the height of the \\(i\\)-th bar as \\(h_i\\) and the position of the \\(i\\)-th bar as \\(i\\). The area of the container formed by the \\(i\\)-th and \\(j\\)-th bars is given by:
\\[ \\text{Area} = (j - i) \\times \\min(h_i, h_j) \\]

We will now calculate the area for each pair of bars:

- For bars at positions 0 and 8: \\((8-0) \\times \\min(39, 40) = 8 \\times 39 = 312\\)
- For bars at positions 0 and 16: \\((16-0) \\times \\min(39, 32) = 16 \\times 32 = 512\\)
- For bars at positions 8 and 16: \\((16-8) \\times \\min(40, 32) = 8 \\times 32 = 256\\)

After checking all pairs, the maximum area is found to be 512.

Thus, the maximum amount of water that can be held is \\(\\boxed{512}\\).
